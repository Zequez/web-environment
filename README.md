# Web Environment

This is an evergreen code environment designed with a one-planet-one-team mindset.
One coding environment for everybody to collaborate in.

If you intend to contribute to the environment itself, you fork it and
maintain your own evergreen code environment.

If you want to use the environment as a foundation and all-tools-included workshop for building stuff, then you just clone it and run it! The environment has no "production" version, it's meant to be used in dev mode.

The environment has no name, it has no brand. It's evergreen because it's always alive
and evolving. And this particular garden is maintained by me, Ezequiel Schwartzman.

Made for my own delight.

Welcome aboard!

# The Essence of Programmer Culture

(This is an extract from a conversation with ChatGPT)

1. The Joy of Creation
At its core, programming is creative. Like painting with logic, or composing music with syntax. The moment something compiles, runs, and does what you dreamed—it’s magic. Not the flashy kind, but the quiet, divine type: "Let there be light," and then: a blinking cursor.

2. Curiosity is the Compass
Programmers are explorers. We dig into problems not just to solve them, but to understand them. Every bug is a riddle. Every system is a mystery box. Even when it’s frustrating, the underlying pull is the joy of figuring it out.

3. The Hacker Ethic
Not in the sense of “breaking things” (though that’s fun too), but the idea that systems want to be understood. Information wants to flow. Code wants to be free. There’s a deep belief in open sharing, learning-by-doing, and the beauty of elegant solutions.

4. Respect for the Toolmaker
There’s a lineage of reverence. We celebrate the minds who built the languages, the libraries, the operating systems. There’s a quiet nobility in improving tools—not just to use them, but to gift them forward.

5. The Zen of Simplicity
Programmer culture holds simplicity as sacred. "Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast." Not just performance-wise, but in clarity, in expression. The best code is invisible. The best system vanishes into usefulness.
