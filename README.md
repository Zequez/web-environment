# Web Environment

This is an evergreen code environment designed with a one-planet-one-team mindset.
One coding environment for everybody to collaborate in.

If you intend to contribute to the environment itself, you fork it and
maintain your own evergreen code environment.

If you want to use the environment as a foundation and all-tools-included workshop for building stuff, then you just clone it and run it! The environment has no "production" version, it's meant to be used in dev mode.

The environment has no name, it has no brand. It's evergreen because it's always alive
and evolving. And this particular garden is maintained by me, Ezequiel Schwartzman.

Made for my own delight.

Welcome aboard!

# The Essence of Programmer Culture

(This is an extract from a conversation with ChatGPT)

1. The Joy of Creation
At its core, programming is creative. Like painting with logic, or composing music with syntax. The moment something compiles, runs, and does what you dreamed—it’s magic. Not the flashy kind, but the quiet, divine type: "Let there be light," and then: a blinking cursor.

2. Curiosity is the Compass
Programmers are explorers. We dig into problems not just to solve them, but to understand them. Every bug is a riddle. Every system is a mystery box. Even when it’s frustrating, the underlying pull is the joy of figuring it out.

3. The Hacker Ethic
Not in the sense of “breaking things” (though that’s fun too), but the idea that systems want to be understood. Information wants to flow. Code wants to be free. There’s a deep belief in open sharing, learning-by-doing, and the beauty of elegant solutions.

4. Respect for the Toolmaker
There’s a lineage of reverence. We celebrate the minds who built the languages, the libraries, the operating systems. There’s a quiet nobility in improving tools—not just to use them, but to gift them forward.

5. The Zen of Simplicity
Programmer culture holds simplicity as sacred. "Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast." Not just performance-wise, but in clarity, in expression. The best code is invisible. The best system vanishes into usefulness.

## Sponsor me -- Buy my Presence Service credits!

Is this turning you on? Is your mindstuff filling up with possibility? Are you a yes for being on my team?

Invest in my future value! Get some credits for future services! _Choose me as your champion!_

At the moment you can schedule an 80 minutes meeting with me using my [Presencial Service appointment scheduler calendar link](https://calendar.app.google/2q2ec3tvjM34qjt49).

[I keep track of credits here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11y-eHGYIN38WtT-EfD_vfo_0u_IFWXNEczPZdQ7QeOU/edit?usp=sharing).


### Credits Rules

- You can have negative credit and compensate afterwards, so if you are feeling bold go ahead and schedule a meeting using the link, and I'll add the corresponding negative credit.
- You can buy credits by sending me money on AirTM using the alias `zequez`, on Wise `zequez@gmail.com`, on Argentina's banking system at the alias `ezequiel.servicio`, or send me a message to create more possibility together.
- I keep the price per hour for Presencial Service on the credits tracking page; applies for the services scheduled via the automated calendar link.
- Credits are expressed in Argentine Pesos, converted upon purchase using Google Finance exchange rate for the day, subject to inflation adjustments.
- You can buy credits with your non-material value (such as your own credits!); send me a message with your proposal

### Sponsorship Perks

You cannot buy these things. These are gifts that I'm turned on to give away to the people I love!

The perks are activated by negotiating a one-time credit with me. Example: a 1,000+ perk _won't_ be activated by a monthly credit of 100 on the tenth month; but they will activate on any single-time 1000 agreement.

- 100,000 - List you as sponsor on here and my website and link to your website
- 40,000 - Setup a no-maintenance-cost website with your own domain name for you using my evergreen code environment; get the instructions manual, and all the chat support you need.
- 78,300 - Hand painted hand-sized sculpture of Gaia on a hand-made dorodango sphere

I don't negotiate delivery dates, it's a gift and will be on Ezequiel time. And I may change my mind at any time without notice about this.

## Connect with me

If you are looking to connect more casually you can [PM me on Telegram](https://t.me/ezequielschwartzman). I have availabily on other times during the week, and you can also find me in some public group calls.






<!-- ## Purpose

Empower edgeworkers to use open source collaborative digital technology to radically leverage code-sharing
in order to create an alternative global Internet collaboration system together.

## Experiment #1: Have two people to try the prototype

- Get 2 other people, one with Windows and one with Linux (I'm on OSX), and ask them to help you test
  the system.
  - Document the whole process and write down every difficulties encountered
  - Each person creates a Github account
  - You create one personal repository for each person and invite them as collaborators (one for each)
  - Each person downloads the source code for the Web Environment from a link you share with them
  - Each person initializes the Web Environment (Bun install and such)
  - Each person runs the Web Environment
  - Each person adds the links to their own repos to the Web Environment for self-updating
  - You make a modification and push the changes
  - Each person should see the environment files self-update
  - Each person makes a change to their repository and push the changes
  - You should see their repository self-update

With this we have the foundation for a collaborative system that needs no technical skills to have
shared code.

- Implementation details
  - Have the source code at https://github.com/zequez/web-environment
  - Have an Electron app running with a simple menu listing itself (the Web Environment repo) and
    the sub-repos.
    - Each item should have
      - Title
      - Repository URL (opens the web on click)
      - System path (opens the filesystem browser on click, Explorer, Finder, etc)
      - Status: Local Updated | Remote Updated | Conflict (both updated) | Synced
      - Sync button
      - Remove button (with confirmation)
    - On top there should be a toggle "auto-update" that automatically pulls changes from the
      the repositories (rather than having to click "sync")
    - There should also be an auto-push button that automatically pushes changes to the remote
      repositories.
      - If there are changed files during push, all files are added and an automatic commit
        is created with a timestamp
    - You should be able to add/remove repos
      - When adding a repo it should pull it as soon as it's added

- Have a source code that is linked to a specific Github Repository branch
- As the app is opened in development mode, it runs as a normal app in your system
- The app can self-update from a Github Repository branch, with a visual UI for handling that
- The app has a sub-directory where it can watch Github Repositories and also keep them updated
- The app has a UI for pushing changes to any of the repositories



## Experiment #2: Have two people publish a website setting up Github pages -->
