# Web Environment

This is an evergreen code environment designed with a one-planet-one-team mindset.
One coding environment for everybody to collaborate in.

If you intend to contribute to the environment itself, you fork it and
maintain your own evergreen code environment.

If you want to use the environment as a foundation and all-tools-included workshop for building stuff, then you just clone it and run it! The environment has no "production" version, it's meant to be used in dev mode.

The environment has no name, it has no brand. It's evergreen because it's always alive
and evolving.

Made for my own delight.

Welcome aboard!
